# Folder Sorter
Often we all come across a directory that is completely unorganised and hence it takes a lot of time to locate particular files. Folder Sorter is a python based application that organises and arranges a particular directory in a particular order which makes the directory clean and clutter free.

### Steps to achieve a cluster free Directory
   1) Place the python file "sorting_data.py" in the directory you want to sort 
   2) Open command prompt and navigate to the respective directory
   3) type python3 sorting_data.py and press ENTER
   4) Done!
   
### NOTE:
    You can use this script to organize other files also by changing the code.
    
### Future Scope:
    To take the location from user and sort automatically without doing the navigation part
